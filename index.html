      <h3>Movie Review</h3>
      <p>
        Here, I share my thoughts and reviews on movies that have inspired or entertained me.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Movie:</strong> The Shawshank Redemption </li>
        <li><strong>Review:</strong> Even under the most oppressive circumstances, human spirit and hope can triumph.</li>
        <li>The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece that goes beyond being just a prison-break movie; it is a profound study of human spirit, endurance, and freedom.
          The storytelling is subtle yet powerful, and every scene, every character, carries layers of meaning. Andy's quiet determination, Red‚Äôs transformation from a man of despair to one of belief, and the exploration of institutionalization in prison life are portrayed brilliantly.
          The movie's cinematography, screenplay, and Morgan Freeman's voiceover narration elevate the emotional depth.
          Personally, I was most impacted by how the movie treats the passage of time ‚Äî how patience, silent perseverance, and faith can slowly carve paths through seemingly immovable barriers.
          It's a film that leaves you introspecting about life, choices, freedom, and the invisible cages we all sometimes live in.</li>
        <li><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Hope is not naive ‚Äî it is a discipline, a powerful tool for survival and growth.</li>
        <li>The most important learning I take away from The Shawshank Redemption is the power of resilience and hope.
          No matter how difficult the situation, consistent efforts combined with inner belief can eventually lead to success.
          It teaches that true freedom is often a mental state ‚Äî that even if circumstances are controlling us externally, maintaining hope keeps our spirit unbroken.
          The movie also emphasizes patience, intelligence, strategic thinking, and emotional strength. Andy's journey shows that one doesn't need to rebel loudly to make a difference; quiet, focused action can change one‚Äôs destiny.
          Lastly, it reminds me how important it is to not lose oneself to systems, failures, or disappointments ‚Äî and to continue dreaming beyond temporary confinements.</li>
          <li><strong>Related concept taught in classroom :</strong></li>
          <li>Psychological Resilience:
            In psychology classes, we learned about resilience ‚Äî the ability to adapt well to adversity, trauma, or stress. Andy's character is a textbook example of psychological resilience in action.</li>
            <li>Institutionalization and Learned Helplessness:
              Sociology and psychology taught us how long-term institutionalization (like living in prison for decades) can make individuals fearful of freedom and dependent on a structured environment, as seen through the character Brooks. This is directly linked to the concept of learned helplessness, where repeated exposure to uncontrollable situations leads individuals to stop trying to change their circumstances.</li>
              <li>Strategic Planning and Problem Solving:
                In management and logical reasoning topics, we discussed goal setting, planning, and executing a vision over time. Andy‚Äôs long-term vision and strategic execution to escape the prison align closely with those frameworks.</li>
                <li>Hope Theory (Positive Psychology):
                  Hope, as studied under positive psychology, consists of having goals, the willpower to pursue them, and the pathways to achieve them. Andy epitomizes this theory throughout the movie.</li>
